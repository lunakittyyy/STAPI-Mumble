# STAPI-Mumble
Babric + StationAPI port of the original Rigasumi's Mod Loader Mumble Link mod.

The mod and its companion native assemblies are heavily based upon [this commit](https://sourceforge.net/p/modmumblelink/code/72/tree/) of the original mod.

# Compatibility
This mod supports 64-bit Windows and Linux only.

32-bit JVMs and macOS are not supported as opposed to the original RML mod, but contributions for macOS native assemblies are very welcome.
